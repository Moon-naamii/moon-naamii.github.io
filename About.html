        <p>Ariel Bélair is a Red River Métis visual artist and designer currently researching narrative and ideology in adoption and displacement. Primarily working with design, she subverts Canadian and Christian propaganda by creating her own publications to disseminate, hoping to cause people to think twice about their internalized belief systems. She explores her own family history of intergenerational patterns of adoption and disconnection, intertwining her work with personal imagery connecting her to her ancestors and descendants. Thinking about the sky and astrology, about the moon, ceremony, cycles, birth charts, paths, and wayfinding. How we use the sky and the stars to literally find our way through life but also as a way to contextualize and make sense of our paths in a more spiritual sense. With a focus on community, education, and problem solving, she seeks ways to use her work for ethical purposes.</p>
